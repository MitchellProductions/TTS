TTSRec00001|Author of the danger trail, Philip Steels, etc.
TTSRec00002|Not at this particular case, Tom, apologized Whittemore.
TTSRec00003|For the twentieth time that evening the two men shook hands.
TTSRec00004|Lord, but I'm glad to see you again, Phil.
TTSRec00005|Will we ever forget it.
TTSRec00006|God bless 'em, I hope I'll go on seeing them forever.
TTSRec00007|And you always want to see it in the superlative degree.
TTSRec00008|Gad, your letter came just in time.
TTSRec00009|He turned sharply, and faced Gregson across the table.
TTSRec00010|I'm playing a single hand in what looks like a losing game.
TTSRec00011|If I ever needed a fighter in my life I need one now.
TTSRec00012|Gregson shoved back his chair and rose to his feet.
TTSRec00013|He was a head shorter than his companion, of almost delicate physique.
TTSRec00014|Now you're coming down to business, Phil, he exclaimed.
TTSRec00015|It's the aurora borealis.
TTSRec00016|There's Fort Churchill, a rifle-shot beyond the ridge, asleep.
TTSRec00017|From that moment his friendship for Belize turns to hatred and jealousy.
TTSRec00018|There was a change now.
TTSRec00019|I followed the line of the proposed railroad, looking for chances.
TTSRec00020|Clubs and balls and cities grew to be only memories.
TTSRec00021|It fairly clubbed me into recognizing it.
TTSRec00022|Hardly were our plans made public before we were met by powerful opposition.
TTSRec00023|A combination of Canadian capital quickly organized and petitioned for the same privileges.
TTSRec00024|It was my reports from the north which chiefly induced people to buy.
TTSRec00025|I was about to do this when cooler judgment prevailed.
TTSRec00026|It occurred to me that there would have to be an accounting.
TTSRec00027|To my surprise he began to show actual enthusiasm in my favor.
TTSRec00028|Robbery, bribery, fraud, 
TTSRec00029|Their forces were already moving into the north country.
TTSRec00030|I had faith in them.
TTSRec00031|They were three hundred yards apart.
TTSRec00032|Since then some mysterious force has been fighting us at every step.
TTSRec00033|He unfolded a long typewritten letter, and handed it to Gregson.
TTSRec00034|Men of Selden's stamp don't stop at women and children.
TTSRec00035|He stopped, and Philip nodded at the horrified question in his eyes.
TTSRec00036|She turned in at the hotel.
TTSRec00037|I was the only one who remained sitting.
TTSRec00038|We'll have to watch our chances.
TTSRec00039|The ship should be in within a week or ten days.
TTSRec00040|I suppose you wonder why she is coming up here.
TTSRec00041|Meanwhile I'll go out to breathe a spell.
TTSRec00042|How could he explain his possession of the sketch.
TTSRec00043|It seemed nearer to him since he had seen and talked with Gregson.
TTSRec00044|Her own betrayal of herself was like tonic to Philip.
TTSRec00045|He moved away as quietly as he had come.
TTSRec00046|The girl faced him, her eyes shining with sudden fear.
TTSRec00047|Close beside him gleamed the white fangs of the wolf-dog.
TTSRec00048|He looked at the handkerchief more, closely.
TTSRec00049|Gregson was asleep when he re-entered the cabin.
TTSRec00050|In spite of their absurdity the words affected Philip curiously.
TTSRec00051|The lace was of a delicate ivory color, faintly tinted with yellow.
TTSRec00052|It was a curious coincidence.
TTSRec00053|Suddenly his fingers closed tightly over the handkerchief.
TTSRec00054|There was nothing on the rock.
TTSRec00055|Philip stood undecided, his ears strained to catch the slightest sound.
TTSRec00056|Pearce's little eyes were fixed on him shrewdly.
TTSRec00057|I have no idea, replied Philip.
TTSRec00058|I came for information more out of curiosity than anything else.
TTSRec00059|His immaculate appearance was gone.
TTSRec00060|Anyway, no one saw her like that.
TTSRec00061|Philip snatched at the letter which Gregson held out to him.
TTSRec00062|The men stared into each other's face.
TTSRec00063|Yes, it was a man who asked, a stranger.
TTSRec00064|The fourth and fifth days passed without any developments.
TTSRec00065|They closed now until his fingers were like cords of steel.
TTSRec00066|He saw Jeanne falter for a moment.
TTSRec00067|Surely I will excuse you, she cried.
TTSRec00068|In a flash Philip followed its direction.
TTSRec00069|It was his intention to return to Eileen and her father.
TTSRec00070|He would first hunt up Gregson and begin his work there.
TTSRec00071|What was the object of your little sensation.
TTSRec00072|But who was Eileen's double.
TTSRec00073|The promoter's eyes were heavy, with little puffy bags under them.
TTSRec00074|And now, down there, Eileen was waiting for him.
TTSRec00075|There has been a change, she interrupted him.
TTSRec00076|The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened.
TTSRec00077|It is the fire, partly, she said.
TTSRec00078|Then, and at supper, he tried to fathom her.
TTSRec00079|It was a large canoe.
TTSRec00080|What if Jeanne failed him.
TTSRec00081|What if she did not come to the rock.
TTSRec00082|His face was streaming with blood.
TTSRec00083|A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes.
TTSRec00084|Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot open.
TTSRec00085|A trickle of fresh blood ran over his face.
TTSRec00086|Death had come with terrible suddenness.
TTSRec00087|Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man.
TTSRec00088|He made sure that the magazine was loaded, and resumed his paddling.
TTSRec00089|The nightglow was treacherous to shoot by.
TTSRec00090|The singing voice approached rapidly.
TTSRec00091|His blood grew hot with rage at the thought.
TTSRec00092|He went down in midstream, searching the shadows of both shores.
TTSRec00093|For a full minute he crouched and listened.
TTSRec00094|He had barely entered this when he saw the glow of a fire.
TTSRec00095|A big canvas tent was the first thing to come within his vision.
TTSRec00096|Perhaps she had already met her fate a little deeper in the forest.
TTSRec00097|Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among these robes in the bow.
TTSRec00098|Shall I carry you.
TTSRec00099|A maddening joy pounded in his brain.
TTSRec00100|You must sleep, he urged.
TTSRec00101|You, you would not keep the truth from me.
TTSRec00102|He will follow us soon.
TTSRec00103|But there came no promise from the bow of the canoe.
TTSRec00104|She was sleeping under his protection as sweetly as a child.
TTSRec00105|Only, it is so wonderful, so almost impossible to believe.
TTSRec00106|The emotion which she had suppressed burst forth now in a choking sob.
TTSRec00107|If you only could know how I thank you.
TTSRec00108|He waded into the edge of the water and began scrubbing himself.
TTSRec00109|Do you know that you are shaking my confidence in you.
TTSRec00110|Much, replied Jeanne, as tersely.
TTSRec00111|Instead, he joined her; and they ate like two hungry children.
TTSRec00112|He was wounded in the arm.
TTSRec00113|I suppose you picked that lingo up among the Indians.
TTSRec00114|Her words sent a strange chill through Philip.
TTSRec00115|He had no excuse for the feelings which were aroused in him.
TTSRec00116|Was it the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin.
TTSRec00117|She added, with genuine sympathy in her face and voice.
TTSRec00118|Pierre obeys me when we are together.
TTSRec00119|Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward.
TTSRec00120|My right foot feels like that of a Chinese debutante.
TTSRec00121|They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.
TTSRec00122|Two years ago I gave up civilization for this.
TTSRec00123|She had died from cold and starvation.
TTSRec00124|It was Jeanne singing softly over beyond the rocks.
TTSRec00125|He was determined now to maintain a more certain hold upon himself.
TTSRec00126|Each day she became a more vital part of him.
TTSRec00127|It was a temptation, but he resisted it.
TTSRec00128|This one hope was destroyed as quickly as it was born.
TTSRec00129|Her face was against his breast.
TTSRec00130|She was his now, forever.
TTSRec00131|Providence had delivered him through the maelstrom.
TTSRec00132|A cry of joy burst from Philip's lips.
TTSRec00133|Philip began to feel that he had foolishly overestimated his strength.
TTSRec00134|He obeyed the pressure of her hand.
TTSRec00135|I am going to surprise father, and you will go with Pierre.
TTSRec00136|About him, everywhere, were the evidences of luxury and of age.
TTSRec00137|Then he stepped back with a low cry of pleasure.
TTSRec00138|In the picture he saw each moment a greater resemblance to Jeanne.
TTSRec00139|He told himself that as he washed himself and groomed his disheveled clothes.
TTSRec00140|Accept a father's blessing, and with it, this.
TTSRec00141|It seems like a strange pointing of the hand of God.
TTSRec00142|Such things had occurred before, he told Philip.
TTSRec00143|Ah, I had forgotten, he exclaimed.
TTSRec00144|But there was something even more startling than this resemblance.
TTSRec00145|I have to be careful of them, as they tear very easily.
TTSRec00146|Of course, that is uninteresting, she continued.
TTSRec00147|A moment before he was intoxicated by a joy that was almost madness.
TTSRec00148|Now these things had been struck dead within him.
TTSRec00149|For an instant he saw Pierre drawn like a silhouette against the sky.
TTSRec00150|Goodbye, Pierre, he shouted.
TTSRec00151|And MacDougall was beyond the trail, with three weeks to spare.
TTSRec00152|Philip thrust himself against it and entered.
TTSRec00153|MacDougall tapped his forehead suspiciously with a stubby forefinger.
TTSRec00154|He was smooth-shaven, and his hair and eyes were black.
TTSRec00155|Won't you draw up, gentlemen.
TTSRec00156|A strange fire burned in his eyes when Thorpe turned.
TTSRec00157|He had worshiped her, as Dante might have worshiped Beatrice.
TTSRec00158|Does that look good.
TTSRec00159|They look as though he had been drumming a piano all his life.
TTSRec00160|You want to go over and see his gang throw dirt.
TTSRec00161|Take away their foreman and they wouldn't be worth their grub.
TTSRec00162|That's the sub-foreman, explained Thorpe.
TTSRec00163|Philip made no effort to follow.
TTSRec00164|He came first a year ago, and revealed himself to Jeanne.
TTSRec00165|They are to attack your camp tomorrow night.
TTSRec00166|Two days ago Jeanne learned where her father's men were hiding.
TTSRec00167|I was near the cabin, and saw you.
TTSRec00168|Low bush whipped him in the face and left no sting.
TTSRec00169|Suddenly Jeanne stopped for an instant.
TTSRec00170|There was none of the joy of meeting in his face.
TTSRec00171|And when you come back in a few days, bring Eileen.
TTSRec00172|Gregson had left the outer door slightly ajar.
TTSRec00173|The date was nearly eighteen years old.
TTSRec00174|They were the presage of storm.
TTSRec00175|Down there the earth was already swelling with life.
TTSRec00176|For the first time in his life he was yearning for a scrap.
TTSRec00177|She had been thoroughly and efficiently mauled.
TTSRec00178|Every bone in her aged body seemed broken or dislocated.
TTSRec00179|Tomorrow I'm going after that bear, he said.
TTSRec00180|If not, let's say our prayers and go to bed.
TTSRec00181|So cheer up, and give us your paw.
TTSRec00182|This time he did not yap for mercy.
TTSRec00183|And the air was growing chilly.
TTSRec00184|Don't you see, I'm chewing this thing in two.
TTSRec00185|The questions may have come vaguely in his mind.
TTSRec00186|Like a flash he launched himself into the feathered mass of the owl.
TTSRec00187|Ahead of them they saw a glimmer of sunshine.
TTSRec00188|Two gigantic owls were tearing at the carcass.
TTSRec00189|The big-eyed, clucking moose-birds were most annoying.
TTSRec00190|Next to them the Canada jays were most persistent.
TTSRec00191|For a time the exciting thrill of his adventure was gone.
TTSRec00192|He did not rush in.
TTSRec00193|It was edged with ice.
TTSRec00194|He drank of the water cautiously.
TTSRec00195|But a strange thing happened.
TTSRec00196|He began to follow the footprints of the dog.
TTSRec00197|Such a dog the wise driver kills, or turns loose.
TTSRec00198|Sometimes her dreams were filled with visions.
TTSRec00199|Thus had the raw wilderness prepared him for this day.
TTSRec00200|He leapt again, and the club caught him once more.
TTSRec00201|He cried, and swung the club wildly.
TTSRec00202|She turned, fearing that Jacques might see what was in her face.
TTSRec00203|They were following the shore of a lake.
TTSRec00204|The wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him.
TTSRec00205|From now on we're pals.
TTSRec00206|He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.
TTSRec00207|How much was it.
TTSRec00208|Youth had come back to her, freed from the yoke of oppression.
TTSRec00209|It was not a large lake, and almost round.
TTSRec00210|Its diameter was not more than two hundred yards.
TTSRec00211|It drowned all sound that brute agony and death may have made.
TTSRec00212|Fresh cases, still able to walk, they clustered about the spokesman.
TTSRec00213|Between him and the beach was the cane-grass fence of the compound.
TTSRec00214|Besides, he was paid one case of tobacco per head.
TTSRec00215|They die out of spite.
TTSRec00216|The other felt a sudden wave of irritation rush through him.
TTSRec00217|Oppressive as the heat had been, it was now even more oppressive.
TTSRec00218|The ringing of the big bell aroused him.
TTSRec00219|At first he puzzled over something untoward he was sure had happened.
TTSRec00220|A dead man is of no use on a plantation.
TTSRec00221|I don't know why you're here at all.
TTSRec00222|What part of the United States is your home.
TTSRec00223|My, I'm almost homesick for it already.
TTSRec00224|She nodded, and her eyes grew soft and moist.
TTSRec00225|I was brought up the way most girls in Hawaii are brought up.
TTSRec00226|That came before my A B C's.
TTSRec00227|It was the same way with our revolvers and rifles.
TTSRec00228|But it contributed to the smash.
TTSRec00229|The last one I knew was an overseer.
TTSRec00230|Do you know any good land around here.
TTSRec00231|The Resident Commissioner is away in Australia.
TTSRec00232|I cannot follow you, she said.
TTSRec00233|I never allow what can't be changed to annoy me.
TTSRec00234|Why, the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil.
TTSRec00235|His voice was passionately rebellious.
TTSRec00236|Don't you see I hate you.
TTSRec00237|So Hughie and I did the managing ourselves.
TTSRec00238|It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon.
TTSRec00239|He cried in such genuine dismay that she broke into hearty laughter.
TTSRec00240|Wash your hands of me.
TTSRec00241|I think it's much nicer to quarrel.
TTSRec00242|I saw it when she rolled.
TTSRec00243|I only read the quotations.
TTSRec00244|He was the soul of devotion to his employers.
TTSRec00245|Out of his eighteen hundred, he laid aside sixteen hundred each year.
TTSRec00246|You have heard always how he was the lover of the Princess Naomi.
TTSRec00247|They ought to pass here some time today.
TTSRec00248|I had been sad too long already.
TTSRec00249|All eyes, however, were staring at him in certitude of expectancy.
TTSRec00250|He had observed the business life of Hawaii and developed a vaulting ambition.
TTSRec00251|I may manage to freight a cargo back as well.
TTSRec00252|O'Brien had been a clean living young man with ideals.
TTSRec00253|He it was that lived to found the family of the Patino.
TTSRec00254|Straight out they swam, their heads growing smaller and smaller.
TTSRec00255|You won't die of malnutrition, be sure of that.
TTSRec00256|See the length of the body and that elongated neck.
TTSRec00257|They are coming ashore, whoever they are.
TTSRec00258|Soaked in seawater they offset the heat rays.
TTSRec00259|Think of investing in such an adventure.
TTSRec00260|Nobody knew his history, they of the Junta least of all.
TTSRec00261|I have been doubly baptized.
TTSRec00262|They wouldn't be sweeping a big vessel like the Martha.
TTSRec00263|Joan looked triumphantly at Sheldon, who bowed.
TTSRec00264|And I hope you've got plenty of chain out, Captain Young.
TTSRec00265|The discovery seemed to have been made on the spur of the moment.
TTSRec00266|They handled two men already, both grub-thieves.
TTSRec00267|Eli Harding asked, as Shunk started to follow.
TTSRec00268|Now go ahead and tell me in a straightforward way what has happened.
TTSRec00269|That's where they cut off the Scottish Chiefs and killed all hands.
TTSRec00270|And after the bath a shave would not be bad.
TTSRec00271|Now please give a plain statement of what occurred.
TTSRec00272|You can take a vacation on pay.
TTSRec00273|They are big trees and require plenty of room.
TTSRec00274|And Raoul listened again to the tale of the house.
TTSRec00275|There are no kiddies and half grown youths among them.
TTSRec00276|Oolong Atoll was one hundred and forty miles in circumference.
TTSRec00277|McCoy found a stifling, poisonous atmosphere in the pent cabin.
TTSRec00278|It would give me nervous prostration.
TTSRec00279|She said with chattering teeth.
TTSRec00280|I'll be out of my head in fifteen minutes.
TTSRec00281|I do not blame you for anything; remember that.
TTSRec00282|If you mean to insinuate -- Brentwood began hotly.
TTSRec00283|The woman in you is only incidental, accidental, and irrelevant.
TTSRec00284|There was no forecasting this strange girl's processes.
TTSRec00285|But what they want with your toothbrush is more than I can imagine.
TTSRec00286|Give them their choice between a fine or an official whipping.
TTSRec00287|Keep an eye on him.
TTSRec00288|Those are my oysters, he said at last.
TTSRec00289|They are not regular oyster pirates, Nicholas continued.
TTSRec00290|One by one the boys were captured.
TTSRec00291|The weeks had gone by, and no overt acts had been attempted.
TTSRec00292|Here, in the midmorning, the first casualty occurred.
TTSRec00293|They were deep in the primeval forest.
TTSRec00294|He had been foiled in his attempt to escape.
TTSRec00295|And twenty men could hold it with spears and arrows.
TTSRec00296|Bassett was a fastidious man.
TTSRec00297|There's a big English general right now whose name is Roberts.
TTSRec00298|This tacit promise of continued acquaintance gave Saxon a little joy-thrill.
TTSRec00299|I tell you I am disgusted with this adventure tomfoolery and rot.
TTSRec00300|From my earliest recollection my sleep was a period of terror.
TTSRec00301|But all my dreams violated this law.
TTSRec00302|It is very plausible to such people, a most convincing hypothesis.
TTSRec00303|But they make the mistake of ignoring their own duality.
TTSRec00304|I graduated last of my class.
TTSRec00305|They had no fixed values, to be altered by adjectives and adverbs.
TTSRec00306|He was pressing beyond the limits of his vocabulary.
TTSRec00307|Very early in my life, I separated from my mother.
TTSRec00308|His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it.
TTSRec00309|White Leghorns, said Mrs Mortimer.
TTSRec00310|Massage under tension, was the cryptic reply.
TTSRec00311|Therefore, hurrah for the game.
TTSRec00312|It lived in perpetual apprehension of that quarter of the compass.
TTSRec00313|Broken-Tooth yelled with fright and pain.
TTSRec00314|Thus was momentum gained in the Younger World.
TTSRec00315|Saxon waited, for she knew a fresh idea had struck Billy.
TTSRec00316|We had been chased by them ourselves, more than once.
TTSRec00317|He was a wise hyena.
TTSRec00318|Production is doubling and quadrupling upon itself.
TTSRec00319|And the Edinburgh Evening News says, with editorial gloom.
TTSRec00320|With my strength I slammed it full into Red-Eye's face.
TTSRec00321|The log on which Lop-Ear was lying got adrift.
TTSRec00322|This is a common experience with all of us.
TTSRec00323|He considered the victory already his and stepped forward to the meat.
TTSRec00324|It was not Red-Eye's way to forego revenge so easily.
TTSRec00325|Whiz-zip-bang. Lop-Ear screamed with sudden anguish.
TTSRec00326|Cherokee identified himself with his instinct.
TTSRec00327|They were less stooped than we, less springy in their movements.
TTSRec00328|The Fire People, like ourselves, lived in caves.
TTSRec00329|Ah, indeed.
TTSRec00330|Red-Eye never committed a more outrageous deed.
TTSRec00331|Poor little Crooked-Leg was terribly scared.
TTSRec00332|Unconsciously, our yells and exclamations yielded to this rhythm.
TTSRec00333|This is no place for you.
TTSRec00334|He'll knock you off a few sticks in no time.
TTSRec00335|Red-Eye swung back and forth on the branch farther down.
TTSRec00336|So unexpected was my charge that I knocked him off his feet.
TTSRec00337|Encouraged by my conduct, Big-Face became a sudden ally.
TTSRec00338|The fighting had now become intermittent.
TTSRec00339|They obeyed him, and went here and there at his commands.
TTSRec00340|It was like the beating of hoofs.
TTSRec00341|Why, doggone you all, shake again.
TTSRec00342|Seventeen, no, eighteen days ago.
TTSRec00343|You mean for this State, General, Alberta.
TTSRec00344|He seemed to fill it with his tremendous vitality.
TTSRec00345|She was trying to pass the apron string around him.
TTSRec00346|Get down and dig in.
TTSRec00347|They are greatly delighted with anything that is bright or giveth a sound.
TTSRec00348|They only lifted seven hundred and fifty.
TTSRec00349|It was simple, in its way, and no virtue of his.
TTSRec00350|Is that Pat Hanrahan's mug looking hungry and willing.
TTSRec00351|It was more like sugar.
TTSRec00352|I'm sure going along with you all, Elijah.
TTSRec00353|Here the explosion of mirth drowned him out.
TTSRec00354|Fresh meat they failed to obtain.
TTSRec00355|A burst of laughter was his reward.
TTSRec00356|You don't catch me at any such foolishness.
TTSRec00357|A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek remained quiet.
TTSRec00358|They continued valiantly to lie, but the truth continued to outrun them.
TTSRec00359|Earth and gravel seemed to fill the pan.
TTSRec00360|But he no longer cared quite so much for that form of diversion.
TTSRec00361|But he did not broach it, preferring to mature it carefully.
TTSRec00362|Nope, not the slightest idea.
TTSRec00363|It is not an attempt to smash the market.
TTSRec00364|We have plenty of capital ourselves, and yet we want more.
TTSRec00365|These rumors may even originate with us.
TTSRec00366|A wildly exciting time was his during the week preceding Thursday the eighteenth.
TTSRec00367|There is not an iota of truth in it, certainly not.
TTSRec00368|I just do appreciate it without being able to express my feelings.
TTSRec00369|In partnership with Daylight, the pair raided the San Jose Interurban.
TTSRec00370|He saw all men in the business game doing this.
TTSRec00371|It issued a rate of forty two dollars a car on charcoal.
TTSRec00372|He saw only the effect in a general, sketchy way.
TTSRec00373|Points of view, new ideas, life.
TTSRec00374|But life's worth more than cash, she argued.
TTSRec00375|The butchers and meat cutters refused to handle meat destined for unfair restaurants.
TTSRec00376|Your price, my son, is just about thirty per week.
TTSRec00377|This sound did not disturb the hush and awe of the place.
TTSRec00378|That's why its boundaries are all gouged and jagged.
TTSRec00379|How old are you, daddy.
TTSRec00380|But in the canyons water was plentiful and also a luxuriant forest growth.
TTSRec00381|My name's Ferguson.
TTSRec00382|Daylight found himself charmed and made curious by the little man.
TTSRec00383|To his surprise, her answer was flat and uncompromising.
TTSRec00384|The farmer works the soil and produces grain.
TTSRec00385|That's what Carnegie did.
TTSRec00386|I can't argue with you, and you know that.
TTSRec00387|Bob, growing disgusted, turned back suddenly and attempted to pass Mab.
TTSRec00388|It was my idea to a tee.
TTSRec00389|Mab, she said.
TTSRec00390|I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
TTSRec00391|But he reconciled himself to it by an act of faith.
TTSRec00392|There is that magnificent Bob, eating his head off in the stable.
TTSRec00393|Already he had begun borrowing from the banks.
TTSRec00394|It's the strap hangers that'll keep us from going under.
TTSRec00395|As for himself, weren't the street railway earnings increasing steadily.
TTSRec00396|A rising tide of fat had submerged them.
TTSRec00397|Call me that again, he murmured ecstatically.
TTSRec00398|In the car were Unwin and Harrison, while Jones sat with the chauffeur.
TTSRec00399|And here's another idea.
TTSRec00400|Manuel had one besetting sin.
TTSRec00401|The man smiled grimly, and brought a hatchet and a club.
TTSRec00402|Curly rushed her antagonist, who struck again and leaped aside.
TTSRec00403|His newborn cunning gave him poise and control.
TTSRec00404|Perrault found one with head buried in the grub box.
TTSRec00405|It seemed the ordained order of things that dogs should work.
TTSRec00406|And that was the last of Francois and Perrault.
TTSRec00407|Mercedes screamed, cried, laughed, and manifested the chaotic abandonment of hysteria.
TTSRec00408|The Eldorado emptied its occupants into the street to see the test.
TTSRec00409|He could feel a new stir in the land.
TTSRec00410|So we have to fit the boat throughout with oil lamps as well.
TTSRec00411|It will break our hearts and our backs to hoist anchor by hand.
TTSRec00412|There is another virtue in these bulkheads.
TTSRec00413|But I am at the end of my resources.
TTSRec00414|Now our figuring was all right.
TTSRec00415|It lasted as a deterrent for two days.
TTSRec00416|The added weight had a velocity of fifteen miles per hour.
TTSRec00417|It is also an insidious, deceitful sun.
TTSRec00418|The Portuguese boy crawled nearer and nearer.
TTSRec00419|The Portuguese boy passed the Hawaiian.
TTSRec00420|When I came to I was waving my hat and murmuring ecstatically.
TTSRec00421|By golly, the boy wins.
TTSRec00422|Halfway around the track one donkey got into an argument with its rider.
TTSRec00423|McVeigh when he returns from a trip to Honolulu.
TTSRec00424|Obviously, it was a disease that could be contracted by contact.
TTSRec00425|Otherwise no restriction is put upon their seafaring.
TTSRec00426|They do not know the length of time of incubation.
TTSRec00427|Enters now the psychology of the situation.
TTSRec00428|It was not exactly a deportation.
TTSRec00429|Quick was the disappointment in his face, yet smiling was the acquiescence.
TTSRec00430|Nevertheless we found ourselves once more in the high seat of abundance.
TTSRec00431|Wada and Nakata were in a bit of a funk.
TTSRec00432|The boy at the wheel lost his head.
TTSRec00433|To her the bridge was tambo, which is the native for taboo.
TTSRec00434|A half a case of tobacco was worth three pounds.
TTSRec00435|What do you mean by this outrageous conduct.
TTSRec00436|But Martin smiled a superior smile.
TTSRec00437|By that answer my professional medical prestige stood or fell.
TTSRec00438|At sea, Monday, March 16, 1908.
TTSRec00439|At sea, Wednesday, March 18, 1908.
TTSRec00440|Yes, sir, I corrected.
TTSRec00441|Violent life and athletic sports had never appealed to me.
TTSRec00442|You live on an income which your father earned.
TTSRec00443|He was worth nothing to the world.
TTSRec00444|Then you don't believe in altruism.
TTSRec00445|The creative joy, I murmured.
TTSRec00446|He deluged me, overwhelmed me with argument.
TTSRec00447|Ah, it is growing dark and darker.
TTSRec00448|I was Hump, cabin boy on the schooner Ghost.
TTSRec00449|A sinewy hand, dripping with water, was clutching the rail.
TTSRec00450|No man ate of the seal meat or the oil.
TTSRec00451|I noticed blood spouting from Kerfoot's left hand.
TTSRec00452|Three oilers and a fourth engineer, was his greeting.
TTSRec00453|Eighteen hundred, he calculated.
TTSRec00454|The sharp voice of Wolf Larsen aroused me.
TTSRec00455|I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him.
TTSRec00456|But it won't continue, she said with easy confidence.
TTSRec00457|What I saw I could not at first believe.
TTSRec00458|The stout wood was crushed like an eggshell.
TTSRec00459|There's too much of the schoolboy in me.
TTSRec00460|I had forgotten their existence.
TTSRec00461|Ah, we were very close together in that moment.
TTSRec00462|But she swung obediently on her heel into the wind.
TTSRec00463|They are his tongue, by which he makes his knowledge articulate.
TTSRec00464|Between the rush of the cascades, streaks of rust showed everywhere.
TTSRec00465|He'll never do a tap of work the whole Voyage.
TTSRec00466|Captain West may be a Samurai, but he is also human.
TTSRec00467|And so early in the voyage, too.
TTSRec00468|In the matter of curry she is a sheer genius.
TTSRec00469|The eastern heavens were equally spectacular.
TTSRec00470|He spat it out like so much venom.
TTSRec00471|I saw Mr Pike nod his head grimly and sarcastically.
TTSRec00472|He is too keenly intelligent, too sharply sensitive, successfully to endure.
TTSRec00473|The night was calm and snowy.
TTSRec00474|I sailed third mate in the little Vampire before you were born.
TTSRec00475|His outstretched arm dropped to his side, and he paused.
TTSRec00476|At this moment I felt a stir at my shoulder.
TTSRec00477|Wada, Louis, and the steward are servants of Asiatic breed.
TTSRec00478|Also, she has forbidden them smoking their pipes in the after-room.
TTSRec00479|I tried to read George Moore last night, and was dreadfully bored.
TTSRec00480|Tom Spink has a harpoon.
TTSRec00481|Nimrod replied, with a slight manifestation of sensitiveness.
TTSRec00482|And their chief virtue lies in that they will never wear out.
TTSRec00483|Beyond dispute, Corry Hutchinson had married Mabel Holmes.
TTSRec00484|No-sir-ee.
TTSRec00485|Each insult added to the value of the claim.
TTSRec00486|For the rest, he was a mere automaton.
TTSRec00487|The river bared its bosom, and snorting steamboats challenged the wilderness.
TTSRec00488|Their love burned with increasing brightness.
TTSRec00489|They were artists, not biologists.
TTSRec00490|Both Johnny and his mother shuffled their feet as they walked.
TTSRec00491|And as in denial of guilt, the one-legged boy replied.
TTSRec00492|Burnt out like the crater of a volcano.
TTSRec00493|The boy, O'Brien, was specially maltreated.
TTSRec00494|O'Brien took off his coat and bared his right arm.
TTSRec00495|He bore no grudges and had few enemies.
TTSRec00496|And Tom King patiently endured.
TTSRec00497|King took every advantage he knew.
TTSRec00498|The lines were now very taut.
TTSRec00499|And right there I saw and knew it all.
TTSRec00500|Who the devil gave it to you to be judge and jury.
TTSRec00501|You're joking me, sir, the other managed to articulate.
TTSRec00502|Anything unusual or abnormal was sufficient to send a fellow to Molokai.
TTSRec00503|His beady black eyes saw bargains where other men saw bankruptcy.
TTSRec00504|He was an athlete and a giant.
TTSRec00505|We fished sharks on Niihau together.
TTSRec00506|The Claudine was leaving next morning for Honolulu.
TTSRec00507|In short, my joyous individualism was dominated by the orthodox bourgeois ethics.
TTSRec00508|Soon shall it be thrust back from off prostrate humanity.
TTSRec00509|Yet, in accordance with Ernest's test of truth, it worked.
TTSRec00510|Much more Ernest told them of themselves and of his disillusionment.
TTSRec00511|There is more behind this than a mere university ideal.
TTSRec00512|No, it is a palace, wherein there are many servants.
TTSRec00513|We must give ourselves and not our money alone.
TTSRec00514|We are consumed in our own flesh-pots.
TTSRec00515|But here amongst ourselves let us speak out.
TTSRec00516|Also, there was awe in their faces.
TTSRec00517|Out of abstractions Ernest had conjured a vision and made them see it.
TTSRec00518|Illuminating oil was becoming all profit.
TTSRec00519|Such an act was in direct violation of the laws of the land.
TTSRec00520|He was fond of quoting a fragment from a certain poem.
TTSRec00521|Without them he could not run his empire.
TTSRec00522|For such countries nothing remained but reorganization.
TTSRec00523|They could not continue their method of producing surpluses.
TTSRec00524|At once would be instituted a dozen cooperative commonwealth states.
TTSRec00525|The Oligarchy wanted violence, and it set its agents provocateurs to work.
TTSRec00526|Nowhere did the raw earth appear.
TTSRec00527|The lush vegetation of that sheltered spot make a natural shield.
TTSRec00528|Men who endure it, call it living death.
TTSRec00529|As I say, he had tapped the message very rapidly.
TTSRec00530|Ask him, I laughed, then turned to Pasquini.
TTSRec00531|In what bucolic school of fence he had been taught was beyond imagining.
TTSRec00532|May drought destroy your crops.
TTSRec00533|Dunham, can your boy go along with Jesse.
TTSRec00534|But Johannes could, and did.
TTSRec00535|A new preacher and a new doctrine come to Jerusalem.
TTSRec00536|He would destroy all things that are fixed.
TTSRec00537|He was an enthusiast and a desert dweller.
TTSRec00538|What Pascal glimpsed with the vision of a seer, I have lived.
TTSRec00539|I should like to engage just for one whole life in that.
TTSRec00540|Yea, so are all the lesser animals of today clean.
TTSRec00541|The Warden with a quart of champagne.
TTSRec00542|Without a doubt, some of them have dinner engagements.
TTSRec00543|I had been born with no organic, chemical predisposition toward alcohol.
TTSRec00544|He may anticipate the day of his death.
TTSRec00545|The Italian rancho was a bachelor establishment.
TTSRec00546|I lost my balance and pitched head foremost into the ooze.
TTSRec00547|Men like Joe Goose dated existence from drunk to drunk.
TTSRec00548|Also, churches and preachers I had never known.
TTSRec00549|Do you know that we weigh every pound of coal we burn.
TTSRec00550|This also became part of the daily schedule.
TTSRec00551|All an appearance can know is mirage.
TTSRec00552|Yet he dreams he is immortal, I argue feebly.
TTSRec00553|I am writing these lines in Honolulu, Hawaii.
TTSRec00554|Jack London, Waikiki Beach, Honolulu, Oahu.
TTSRec00555|Jerry was so secure in his nook that he did not roll away.
TTSRec00556|Why, he's bought forty pounds of goods from you already.
TTSRec00557|The last refugee had passed.
TTSRec00558|And the foundation stone of service, in his case, was obedience.
TTSRec00559|Peace be unto you and grace before the Lord.
TTSRec00560|His mouth opened; words shaped vainly on his lips.
TTSRec00561|Bill lingered, contemplating his work with artistic appreciation.
TTSRec00562|What the flaming.
TTSRec00563|Mrs McFee's jaws brought together with a snap.
TTSRec00564|Then it is as I said, Womble announced with finality.
TTSRec00565|With them were Indians, also three other men.
TTSRec00566|Dennin's hands were released long enough for him to sign the document.
TTSRec00567|Now Irvine was a man of impulse, a poet.
TTSRec00568|He was just bursting with joy, joy over what.
TTSRec00569|At Lake Linderman I had one canoe, very good Peterborough canoe.
TTSRec00570|Behind him lay the thousand-years-long road across all Siberia and Russia.
TTSRec00571|He had forgotten to build a fire and thaw out.
TTSRec00572|I never saw anything like her in my life.
TTSRec00573|There was no law on the Yukon save what they made for themselves.
TTSRec00574|Good business man, Curly, O'Brien was saying.
TTSRec00575|There weren't any missions, and he was the man to know.
TTSRec00576|And the big Persian knew of his existence before he did of hers.
TTSRec00577|Once the jews harp began emitting its barbaric rhythms, Michael was helpless.
TTSRec00578|But we'll just postpone this.
TTSRec00579|There was the Emma Louisa.
TTSRec00580|This is my fifth voyage.
TTSRec00581|It was this proposition that started the big idea in Daughtry's mind.
TTSRec00582|Daughtry elaborated on the counting trick by bringing Cocky along.
TTSRec00583|Enjoy it he did, but principally for Steward's sake.
TTSRec00584|I have long noted your thirst unquenchable.
TTSRec00585|Wonder if he's a lion dog, Charles suggested.
TTSRec00586|We don't see ourselves as foolish.
TTSRec00587|He had comparatively no advantages at first.
TTSRec00588|He had proved it today, with his amateurish and sophomoric productions.
TTSRec00589|I was sick once -- typhoid.
TTSRec00590|In a way he is my protege.
TTSRec00591|We are both children together.
TTSRec00592|It's only his indigestion I find fault with.
TTSRec00593|She'd make a good wife for the cashier.
TTSRec00594|Gad, do I remember it.
TTSRec00595|You got out by fighting, and I through a pretty girl.
TTSRec00596|I can see that knife now.
TTSRec00597|When I can't see beauty in woman I want to die.
TTSRec00598|His slim fingers closed like steel about Philip's.
TTSRec00599|He seized Gregson by the arm and led him to the door.
TTSRec00600|Hear the Indian dogs wailing down at Churchill.
TTSRec00601|Burke himself had criticized it because of the smile.
TTSRec00602|I'd say there was going to be a glorious scrap.
TTSRec00603|He turned the map to Gregson, pointing with his finger.
TTSRec00604|His eyes never took themselves for an instant from his companion's face.
TTSRec00605|Something that Whittemore had not yet said thrilled him.
TTSRec00606|Lakes and rivers, hundreds of them, thousands of them.
TTSRec00607|Whitefish, Gregson, whitefish and trout.
TTSRec00608|They robbed me a few years later.
TTSRec00609|He chuckled as he pulled out his pipe and began filling it.
TTSRec00610|Everything was working smoothly, better than I had expected.
TTSRec00611|I was completely lost in my work.
TTSRec00612|His slim hands gripped the edges of the table.
TTSRec00613|He made no reply as he waited for Whittemore to continue.
TTSRec00614|Philip dropped back into his chair.
TTSRec00615|If I was out of the game it would be easily made.
TTSRec00616|MacDougall, my engineer, believes it.
TTSRec00617|It is growing, every day, every hour.
TTSRec00618|Now, you understand.
TTSRec00619|You have associated with some of these men.
TTSRec00620|And there's no chivalry, no quarter shown in this fight.
TTSRec00621|Lord Fitzhugh is the key to the whole situation.
TTSRec00622|All operations have been carried on from Montreal and Toronto.
TTSRec00623|Gregson held a lighted match until it burnt his fingertips.
TTSRec00624|Gregson had seated himself under the lamp and was sharpening a pencil.
TTSRec00625|He caught himself with a jerk.
TTSRec00626|How does your wager look now.
TTSRec00627|He confessed that the sketch had startled him.
TTSRec00628|After all, the picture was only a resemblance.
TTSRec00629|He wondered, too, where Roscoe was.
TTSRec00630|Philip knew that she was not an Indian.
TTSRec00631|In her haste to get away she had forgotten these things.
TTSRec00632|Philip took a step toward Gregson, half determined to awaken him.
TTSRec00633|The thought set his blood tingling.
TTSRec00634|But if Pierre did not return, until tomorrow.
TTSRec00635|Ten minutes had not elapsed since he had dropped the handkerchief.
TTSRec00636|It won't be for sale.
TTSRec00637|For a few moments he ate in silence.
TTSRec00638|Philip did not pursue the subject.
TTSRec00639|Philip produced a couple of cigars and took a chair opposite him.
TTSRec00640|Suppose you saw me at work through the window.
TTSRec00641|He looked like one who had passed through an uncomfortable hour or two.
TTSRec00642|There was nothing more, except a large ink blot under the words.
TTSRec00643|All this day Gregson remained in the cabin.
TTSRec00644|The sixth day he spent in the cabin with Gregson.
TTSRec00645|The flush was gone from her face.
TTSRec00646|That is why I am, am rattled, he laughed.
TTSRec00647|He understood the meaning of the look.
TTSRec00648|She was even more beautiful than when I saw her, before.
TTSRec00649|I'll give a thousand if you produce her, retorted Gregson.
TTSRec00650|They have won popular sentiment through the newspapers.
TTSRec00651|We must achieve our own salvation.
TTSRec00652|In moments of mental energy Philip was restless.
TTSRec00653|He would keep his faith with Gregson for the promised day or two.
TTSRec00654|Something about it seemed to fascinate him, to challenge his presence.
TTSRec00655|Now it was missing from the wall.
TTSRec00656|He boiled himself some coffee and sat down to wait.
TTSRec00657|I'm going down there with you, and I'm going to fight.
TTSRec00658|Now have you got anything to say against me, Mr Philip.
TTSRec00659|If I meet her again I shall apologize, said Eileen.
TTSRec00660|Below him the shadow was broken into a pool of rippling starlight.
TTSRec00661|Only the chance sound had led him to observe them.
TTSRec00662|Could the incident have anything to do with Jeanne and Pierre.
TTSRec00663|There was no chance to fire without hitting him.
TTSRec00664|There was no answer from the other side.
TTSRec00665|Then he hastened on, as Pierre had guided him.
TTSRec00666|With these arguments he convinced himself that he should go on alone.
TTSRec00667|Yet, behind them there was another and more powerful motive.
TTSRec00668|In that case he could not miss them, if he used caution.
TTSRec00669|Before Philip could recover himself Jeanne's startled guards were upon him.
TTSRec00670|It is the nearest refuge.
TTSRec00671|There was pride and strength, the ring of triumph in his voice.
TTSRec00672|The truth of it set Jeanne quivering.
TTSRec00673|Tomorrow it will be strong enough for you to stand upon.
TTSRec00674|You were going to leave after you saw me on the rock.
TTSRec00675|He bit his tongue, and cursed himself at this fresh break.
TTSRec00676|In it there was something that was almost tragedy.
TTSRec00677|Your face is red with blood.
TTSRec00678|Her eyes smiled truth at him as he came up the bank.
TTSRec00679|He can care for himself.
TTSRec00680|They will search for us between their camp and Churchill.
TTSRec00681|Until I die, he exclaimed.
TTSRec00682|Her beautiful hair was done up in shining coils.
TTSRec00683|The Churchill narrowed and its current became swifter as they progressed.
TTSRec00684|For a full half minute Jeanne looked at him without speaking.
TTSRec00685|I want to die in it.
TTSRec00686|Darkness hid him from Jeanne.
TTSRec00687|And yet if she came he had no words to say.
TTSRec00688|He heard a sound which brought him quickly into consciousness of day.
TTSRec00689|Within himself he called it no longer his own.
TTSRec00690|Besides, that noise makes me deaf.
TTSRec00691|Philip looked back from the crest and saw Jeanne leaning over the canoe.
TTSRec00692|Fifty yards ahead of her were the first of the rocks.
TTSRec00693|There was one chance, and only one, of saving Jeanne.
TTSRec00694|You're a devil for fighting, and will surely win.
TTSRec00695|I'll only be in the way.
TTSRec00696|He lifted his eyes, and a strange cry burst from his lips.
TTSRec00697|Shooting pains passed like flashes of electricity through his body.
TTSRec00698|I know that you are in charge there, and Jeanne knows.
TTSRec00699|For a full minute the two men stared into each other's face.
TTSRec00700|He was sure, now, of but few things.
TTSRec00701|It was a miracle, and I owe you my life.
TTSRec00702|Philip ate lightly of the food which Pierre had ready for him.
TTSRec00703|Such men believe, when they come together.
TTSRec00704|The journey was continued at dawn.
TTSRec00705|Jeanne and Pierre both gazed toward the great rock.
TTSRec00706|There was something pathetic in the girl's attitude now.
TTSRec00707|He moved his position, and the illusion was gone.
TTSRec00708|For two hours not a word passed between them.
TTSRec00709|I have hunted along this ridge, replied Philip.
TTSRec00710|That's Thorpe's, said the young engineer.
TTSRec00711|We saw your light, and thought you wouldn't mind a call.
TTSRec00712|Billinger may arrive in time.
TTSRec00713|There's the hitch, replied Thorpe, rolling a cigarette.
TTSRec00714|I want my men to work by themselves.
TTSRec00715|Philip saw MacDougall soon after his short talk with Thorpe.
TTSRec00716|Neither could they understand the growing disaffection among Thorpe's men.
TTSRec00717|Two weeks passed, and in that time Thorpe left camp three times.
TTSRec00718|It was the third or fourth time that Philip had heard MacDougall swear.
TTSRec00719|Blood was oozing slowly from the wounded man's right breast.
TTSRec00720|He destroyed everything that had belonged to the woman.
TTSRec00721|Philip bent low over Pierre.
TTSRec00722|Did Thorpe go to see any one in Churchill.
TTSRec00723|She saw the answer in his face.
TTSRec00724|Thorpe and his men were to destroy this camp, and kill you.
TTSRec00725|There is no need of further detail, now -- for you can understand.
TTSRec00726|There followed a roar that shook the earth.
TTSRec00727|Blind with rage, he darted in.
TTSRec00728|In it was the joy of life.
TTSRec00729|Swiftly his eyes measured the situation.
TTSRec00730|But this little defect did not worry him.
TTSRec00731|And then, steadily, he began to chew.
TTSRec00732|Together they ate the rabbit.
TTSRec00733|They edged nearer, and stood shoulder to shoulder facing their world.
TTSRec00734|It was beating and waiting in the ambush of those black pits.
TTSRec00735|Something vastly more thrilling had come into it now.
TTSRec00736|It took him half an hour to reach the edge of it.
TTSRec00737|But there was no longer the mother yearning in his heart.
TTSRec00738|Besides, had he not whipped the big owl in the forest.
TTSRec00739|After all, it was simply a mistake in judgment.
TTSRec00740|Had it struck squarely it would have killed him.
TTSRec00741|The Indian even poked his stick into the thick ground spruce.
TTSRec00742|Pebbles and dirt flew along with hair and fur.
TTSRec00743|And he was filled with a strange and foreboding fear.
TTSRec00744|It was steel, a fisher trap.
TTSRec00745|OW, a wild dog, he growled.
TTSRec00746|He was a pariah; a wanderer without a friend or a home.
TTSRec00747|That is the strange part of it.
TTSRec00748|His freshly caught furs he flung to the floor.
TTSRec00749|For that reason Le Beau had chosen him to fight the big fight.
TTSRec00750|In the crib the baby sat up and began to prattle.
TTSRec00751|She obeyed, shrinking back with the baby in her arms.
TTSRec00752|His teeth shut with a last click.
TTSRec00753|It was over when he made his way through the ring of spectators.
TTSRec00754|In a flash he was on his feet, facing him.
TTSRec00755|He thought he saw a shudder pass through the Factor's shoulders.
TTSRec00756|The moon had already begun its westward decline.
TTSRec00757|They laughed like two happy children.
TTSRec00758|He pulled, and the log crashed down to break his back.
TTSRec00759|Fast, but endure.
TTSRec00760|A little before dawn of the day following, the fire relief came.
TTSRec00761|The Indian felt the worship of her warm in his heart.
TTSRec00762|He drew in a deep breath as he looked at them.
TTSRec00763|Then he shouted, Shut up.
TTSRec00764|He changed his seat for a steamer reclining chair.
TTSRec00765|On the far corner of the compound fence a hawk brooded.
TTSRec00766|To these he gave castor oil.
TTSRec00767|Hatred and murder and lust for revenge they possessed to overflowing.
TTSRec00768|Sheldon glanced at the thermometer.
TTSRec00769|I'll see to poor Hughie.
TTSRec00770|Her gray eyes were flashing, and her lips were quivering.
TTSRec00771|Also, I want information.
TTSRec00772|Let them go out and eat with my boys.
TTSRec00773|I, I beg pardon, he drawled.
TTSRec00774|And you preferred a cannibal isle and a cartridge belt.
TTSRec00775|I was in New York when the crash came.
TTSRec00776|No, I did not fall among thieves.
TTSRec00777|Such things in her brain were like so many oaths on her lips.
TTSRec00778|Your being wrecked here has been a godsend to me.
TTSRec00779|I can't go elsewhere, by your own account.
TTSRec00780|Her achievements with cocoanuts were a revelation.
TTSRec00781|He glanced down at her helplessly, and moistened his lips.
TTSRec00782|That is what distinguishes all of us from the lower animals.
TTSRec00783|Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy, and his family threw him off.
TTSRec00784|He also contended that better confidence was established by carrying no weapons.
TTSRec00785|Outsiders are allowed five minute speeches, the sick man urged.
TTSRec00786|So was Packard's finish suicide.
TTSRec00787|Joan cried, with shining eyes.
TTSRec00788|Nobody knows how the natives got them.
TTSRec00789|How can you manage all alone, Mr Young.
TTSRec00790|The planters are already considering the matter.
TTSRec00791|I use great trouble advisedly.
TTSRec00792|Dear Sir, Your second victim has fallen on schedule time.
TTSRec00793|We leave the eventuality to time and law.
TTSRec00794|I also understand that similar branch organizations have made their appearance in Europe.
TTSRec00795|Society is shaken to its foundations.
TTSRec00796|A month in Australia would finish me.
TTSRec00797|Down through the perfume weighted air fluttered the snowy fluffs of the cottonwoods.
TTSRec00798|You were destroying my life.
TTSRec00799|Horses and rifles had been her toys, camp and trail her nursery.
TTSRec00800|I'm as good as a man, she urged.
TTSRec00801|You read the quotations in today's paper.
TTSRec00802|He's terribly touchy about his black wards, as he calls them.
TTSRec00803|Whatever he guessed he locked away in the taboo room of Naomi.
TTSRec00804|This is eighteen eighty.
TTSRec00805|Death is and has been ever since old Maui died.
TTSRec00806|Some boy, she laughed acquiescence.
TTSRec00807|Let us talk it over and find a way out.
TTSRec00808|It is a good property, and worth more than that.
TTSRec00809|I wish you were more adaptable, Joan retorted.
TTSRec00810|Such is my passage engaged on the steamer.
TTSRec00811|The issue was not in doubt.
TTSRec00812|Well, there are better men in Hawaii, that's all.
TTSRec00813|Harry Bancroft, Dave lied.
TTSRec00814|It's a Yankee, Joan cried.
TTSRec00815|He was the leader, and Tudor was his lieutenant.
TTSRec00816|They likewise are disinclined to being eaten.
TTSRec00817|But to culture the Revolution thus far had exhausted the Junta.
TTSRec00818|The President of the United States was his friend.
TTSRec00819|Your face was the personification of duplicity.
TTSRec00820|Shorty turned to their employers.
TTSRec00821|You were engaged.
TTSRec00822|I saw it all myself, and it was splendid.
TTSRec00823|Now run along, and tell them to hurry.
TTSRec00824|What's that grub-thief got to do with it.
TTSRec00825|It was a superb picture.
TTSRec00826|So she said, the irate skipper dashed on.
TTSRec00827|And watch out for wet feet, was his parting advice.
TTSRec00828|Raoul yelled, in order to make himself heard.
TTSRec00829|Oolong was two hundred and fifty miles from the nearest land.
TTSRec00830|They just lay off in the bush and plugged away.
TTSRec00831|The very thought of the effort to swim over was nauseating.
TTSRec00832|And there was a dog that barked.
TTSRec00833|There are four, all low, McCoy answered.
TTSRec00834|The women they carried away with them to the Big Valley.
TTSRec00835|The Japanese understood as we could never school ourselves or hope to understand.
TTSRec00836|They had been on the same lay as ourselves.
TTSRec00837|You are positively soulless, he said savagely.
TTSRec00838|Harrison is still my chauffeur.
TTSRec00839|The boy grew and prospered.
TTSRec00840|He wanted to give the finish to this foe already so far gone.
TTSRec00841|Exciting times are the lot of the fish patrol.
TTSRec00842|I know they are my oysters.
TTSRec00843|By this time Charley was as enraged as the Greek.
TTSRec00844|They must have been swept away by the chaotic currents.
TTSRec00845|It resembled tea less than lager beer resembles champagne.
TTSRec00846|The very opposite is true; they are discouraged vagabonds.
TTSRec00847|At the same time spears and arrows began to fall among the invaders.
TTSRec00848|Then, again, Tudor had such an irritating way about him.
TTSRec00849|Outwardly, he maintained a calm and smiling aspect.
TTSRec00850|Tudor surveyed him with withering disgust.
TTSRec00851|You fired me out of your house, in short.
TTSRec00852|Her mouth opened, but instead of speaking she drew a long sigh.
TTSRec00853|It's worth eight dollars.
TTSRec00854|And he did hurt my arm.
TTSRec00855|Saxon's onto her job.
TTSRec00856|Only once did I confide the strangeness of it all to another.
TTSRec00857|But this time it was Saxon who rebelled.
TTSRec00858|I was not to cry out in the face of fear.
TTSRec00859|And now put yourself in my place for a moment.
TTSRec00860|The boy threw back his head with pride.
TTSRec00861|Saxon nodded, and the boy frowned.
TTSRec00862|Why not like any railroad station or ferry depot.
TTSRec00863|We could throw stones with our feet.
TTSRec00864|It was put together in a casual, helter-skelter sort of way.
TTSRec00865|These were merely stout sticks an inch or so in diameter.
TTSRec00866|Then it was that a strange thing happened.
TTSRec00867|From the source of light a harsh voice said.
TTSRec00868|But I did not enjoy it long.
TTSRec00869|We were now good friends.
TTSRec00870|Two of the Folk were already up.
TTSRec00871|Now animals do not like mockery.
TTSRec00872|He gave one last snarl and slid from view among the trees.
TTSRec00873|Again the girls applauded, and Mrs Hall cried.
TTSRec00874|Just the same I'd sooner be myself than have book indigestion.
TTSRec00875|Some of the smaller veins had doubtless been ruptured.
TTSRec00876|But we were without this momentum.
TTSRec00877|There was one difficulty, however.
TTSRec00878|The hyena proceeded to dine.
TTSRec00879|The time was considered auspicious.
TTSRec00880|Or have they already devised one.
TTSRec00881|We would not spend another such night.
TTSRec00882|At first his progress was slow and erratic.
